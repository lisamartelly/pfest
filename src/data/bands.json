Hawthorne releases these songs in hopes that it will create more awareness and spark healthy conversation around mental health, while ultimately helping others feel less alone. \n\nThrough her music, Hawthorne offers a community where mental health, psychological safety, and connection are at the forefront, and she does this by channeling her empathy and compassion. She creates a sense of belonging, mattering, and a safe place for anyone who feels out of space and time, lost in the darkness, or frustrated by the uncertainty, and she does it all while defying the notion that \"kids should be seen and not heard.\" \n\nHawthorne Oachs is a teen multi-hyphenate musical artist, digital artist, and award-nominated actress who has spent the last three years of her life writing, producing, and releasing songs while also balancing being a full-time student, playing her first festivals, comic book stores, coffee shops, acting in a few projects, and creating the cover art for her songs. "

He describes his style of lyricism as \"world-weary and a little literary.\" His music is stylistically Americana and is often compared to Bill Callahan, Craig Finn, and The National.\n\nIn 2021, New Seven released their debut album, The Colossus of Uptown, which gets its name from the near-mythical statue The Colossus of Rhodes. Ian Farmer of Slaughter Beach, Dog, and Modern Baseball said of the album, \"Lyrically, musically, and tonally, it's exceptional from track to track.\"\n\nThese days, Dominic performs under New Seven mainly as a solo act, occasionally collaborating with other musicians and adding lesser-known cover songs discovered during his travels to his ever-growing setlist of original songs."

Caitlin’s writing straddles the feelings of open prairie skies and hurried metropolitan energy.  Their first album is currently in production and will launch with the debut of their first single “Eusebius” in summer of 2024. "
